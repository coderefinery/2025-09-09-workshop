### News

**See all emails to participants on [Communication](@/communication/_index.md)**.

- **News from day 2 / day 3 prep**
  - We covered everything as covered in the schedule
  - **Tomorrow, we show how projects with multiple people would work:**
    both a small group like your own team (centralized), and bigger
    projects (decentralized, not everyone has direct access). It's
    probably the best day.
  - Preparation for tomorrow:
    - If yesterday and today worked, you are probably good for
      tomorrow (Github connection is very important).  If not, please
      look at the installation instructions
    - But you need to request access in advance - this will give you
      access to projects we work on tomorrow. Check your email for
      instructions.
    - It's also like extra practice for everything we have done today.
