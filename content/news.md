### News

**See all emails to participants on [Communication](@/communication/_index.md)**.

- **News from Day 1**
  - We covered what was in the schedule.
  - **Day 2 moves to your local computer**. If today was too boring or easy for you, don't worry!  Day 2 gets to the way we really work.
  - For day 2, If you plan to do the exercises please make sure you
    have a **working git installation in your computer** (e.g. with VS
    Code or with the shell terminal, see instructions at
    https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). (VSCode
    recommended, but command line also works)
- If you had/have issues with the installation, **we will provide a 1h
  support zoom session tomorrow morning 9:00 CEST (Oslo/Rome)**. See email.
