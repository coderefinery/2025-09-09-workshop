CodeRefinery workshop on tools and techniques for reproducible research

Are you writing code for your research?
Do you struggle to reproduce results of your own or others computations?

Join the online CodeRefinery workshop on nine half days: 
- Intro to git and collaborative git: 9+10+11/September 11:00-13:00 + 14:00-15:30 (CEST)
- Reproducible research and other topics spread over 6 following weeks Wednesdays with exercises: 17.9+24.9+1.10+8.10+15.10 + 22.10.

The CodeRefinery workshop aims to support researchers of all domains,
levels and preferred programming languages to write more reproducible research code.

The workshop is held online (streamed on Twitch) with interactive hands-on sessions during the first week.
Some locations may offer in-person events, and you may also join with your own classroom
(please contact us if this option sparks your interest).

The event is free of charge.
