Dear all,

our workshop starts in less than two weeks and we are so excited to have you on board: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/. 


The workshop will stream at: https://twitch.tv/coderefinery. You don't need a Twitch account. You only need a browser. 
For the exercise sessions you can either follow on your own on as part of a group (more info below).

Below we summarize what you can expect and what you need to prepare. 

If your schedule changed and you cannot attend this time, please consider subscribing to our newsletter to get the information about upcoming events: https://coderefinery.org/#newsletter

**Q&A during the workshop**

We will use a HedgeDoc collaborative document for questions and answers and "real-time" communication during the workshop. 
Everyone can read and write in that document. Please use caution and do not remove text that is not yours.

**Preparing for the workshop**

To follow the exercises, please go through our software installation instructions: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/
This takes some time but with a workshop of this size (we expect over 300 participants), we cannot start installing and debugging during the workshop. 
We hope that you will drop by in one of our install help sessions, if you run into any issues:

- Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/#schedule
- Zoom link: https://aalto.zoom.us/j/69608324491 

**Adding the workshop sessions to your calendar**

You can add all workshop sessions to your own calendar following the instructions on this page: https://coderefinery.org/calendars/ (choose only the workshop calendar)

**Shell crash course**

If you are not feeling confident or comfortable using the terminal, 
please join our shell crash course (2 options with same content, same zoom link as installation help session):  
https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/#schedule

**Certificates**

Anyone with an e-mail address associated with a research or higher education institution can request a certificate 
recommending 1 ECTS for the workshop. Detailed instructions: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/


**Teams and local classrooms**

There's still time to gather friends and colleagues to follow the workshop with you. 
If you have/get a team, we suggest you organize a video/in-person meeting for each day you want to participate the workshop.

Unfortunately we realized that we do not have the resources to form teams from individuals who do not know each other yet 
and we need to rely that teams self-organize. But don't worry, also participating as individual means you get the full workshop experience.

For those who are interested in joining an in-person classroom, we have rooms available in 
Espoo, Reykjavik, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo, please register separately: 
https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/#local-exercise-groups


We wish you all a happy and educating workshop! 

On behalf of the CodeRefinery team,

Enrico and Samantha
