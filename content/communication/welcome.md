Dear all,

We are happy to have you onboard of the next Coderefinery workshop that starts on **Tuesday September 9th** at 11am CET. Full schedule and details at the [**Septmber 2025 CodeRefinery workshop webpage**](https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/
). 


### Before the workshop: pre-requisites

If you plan to participate in the hands-on exercises for this workshop, please ensure you have the [**necessary pre-requisites prepared by visiting this link**](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).  

We provide multiple ways to learn Git: via GitHub web-interface, using the shell terminal, using VS code.

Using Git in the shell terminal gives you full control over your workflow, but you might not be familiar with the terminal itself. If you’d like to take advantage of Git’s full power through the command line, we offer a [**shell crash course**](https://youtu.be/xbTTDLA3txI) just before our installation session.

If you need assistance with the installation, we offer two help sessions on **Wednesday September 3rd** and **Monday September 8th**. Please check the schedule in your time zone: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/#schedule . You can also ask someone you know for installation help - these are standard tools and they can probably give you custom advice.

Connection details for the installation help sessions and the shell crash course: **zoom link sent to participants** .
