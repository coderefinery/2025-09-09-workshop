Dear all,

Thank you so much for your active participation during the first four days of the CodeRefinery workshop. We have had more than 700 views so far, we are happy to see that you find our training useful! You can find recordings of the past episodes at the [CodeRefinery YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fwmkB2A6Vs&list=PLpLblYHCzJAAqSSVAwHUuipB5hhW6GobY).

**If you could not join us so far, could you let us know why? [Take this 15-seconds-survey](https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/BCA7C9465741A5AC)**.

Tomorrow, Wednesday 23/September, we continue our weekly series of self-contained events focused on specific topics. 

Tomorrow's episode is dedicated to **social coding**: open-source software, software licenses, and how to publish your code. To work in modern science, you need to build on the work of others - both scientific and code. Can you copy code from Stack Overflow? Can you copy from your colleagues? Can you copy form ChatGPT? Does your code and data exist after you leave your position? We'll discuss all these and more.

The exercises tomorrow will not require any Python or git. 

If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.
