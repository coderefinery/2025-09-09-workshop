Dear all,

We are near the end of the CodeRefinery workshop series, but we still have two very important and often overlooked topics coming up!

Tomorrow, Wednesday 15th/October, we continue our weekly series of self-contained events focused on specific topics.

Tomorrows episode is dedicated to automated testing: 
We will step a little deeper into software development practices by giving you an introduction into automated testing and how this could benefit you and your collaborators. We will take a look how testing can be integrated as part of the research code development cycle and practice designing and writing tests.

If you want to follow the exercises tomorrow with Python you will need the CodeRefinery conda environment setup (https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/conda/). You may also follow some of the exercises in R, Julia, C++ or Fortran, please refer to the language specific instructions in the test design lesson: https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/ . 

If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.
