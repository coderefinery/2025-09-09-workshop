Hei classroom hosts and exercise/team leads,

You are receiving this e-mail because you have indicated in some way that you are hosting a classroom or joining with a team for the CodeRefinery workshop.

First: it's amazing that you provide a space to learn together for the CodeRefinery workshop! We know it's still a day ahead, but never too early to prepare: For day 3 we do collaborative git version control, and that requires you to prepare some repositories in advance so that the learner in your room can collaborate using the repository you have created.

Please have a look at all exercises for day 3 (https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/exercises/#day-3), there are step-by-step instructions on how to prepare these git repositories for your learners to work with.

For example, for the first exercise of day 3 https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/same-repository/#exercise you see that in the tab "Part of team/exercise room" there are a few steps for the **maintainer** (you! (or one of you if you have multiple helpers)) to generate the new repositories under your own github handle, and to add the learners as collaborators to your repository. (You will also need to create a repository for the third exercise of day 3 https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/forking-workflow/#exercise.) It is good to do this before day 3 sessions start.

If you would like support with setting things up, please visit our "additional installation help" session on Wednesday, 2 hours before the workshop starts.

Please do reach out via support@coderefinery.org or join our Zulip chat (https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) if anything is unclear.

Kind regards,
Samantha on behalf of the CodeRefinery team
