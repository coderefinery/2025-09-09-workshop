Hello dear workshop participant,

Thank you for joining us today!

You may find the archived questions and answers at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09/workshop/questions/.

If you'd like to revisit or catch up with some of the episodes, you find the videos on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week. Recordings will later be uploaded to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@coderefinery.

If you missed day 1, you may still join the rest of the workshop; prerequisites for day 2 are knowing the basics of git. And even without those, you should still be able to follow and do the exercises.

Preparations for day 2
Having the local editors available on your computer is good: VS Code or command line. See the second option on installation (https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). If you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps you can do without editors, and you'll learn for the future. 

If you need live help for installing these tools, we provide an exceptional zoom session tomorrow morning 10/9/2025 at 9:00am CEST (Oslo/Stockholm/Rome timezone). 

Preparations for day 3
On Day 3 (Thursday 11/9) we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.

Day 3 for individual learners
If you would like to participate as individual learner in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at
https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new?template=access-request.md (there click the green button "Create" on bottom right).

This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.
After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.
Please accept the invitation so that on Thursday you can do the exercise on our shared repository.

Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise 
 and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded  to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.
To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".

Day 3 for learners in local classrooms or teams
If you are learning with others as part of an in-person room or a virtual team, your local coordinator will take care of preparing the shared git repository for doing the collaborative exercise with other participants in the room. If you are the coordinator you'll receive a separate email from us with more detailed instructions.
