Dear all,

Thank you so much for your active participation during the first days of the CodeRefinery workshop.

Tomorrow, Wednesday 8th/October, we continue our weekly series of self-contained events focused on specific topics. 

Tomorrow's episode is dedicated to **Jupyter notebooks**: Have you ever wished your code, data, and explanations could live together in one beautiful, shareable document? How are Jupyter notebooks used in research projects?

The exercises tomorrow will require Python or and the CodeRefinery conda environment. 

If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.
