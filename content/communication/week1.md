Dear all,

Thank you so much for your active participation during the first week of the CodeRefinery workshop!

**If you could not join us this week, could you let us know why? [Take this 15-seconds-survey](https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/BCA7C9465741A5AC)**.

We try to minimise overlaps with conferences and other events, so we would like to know what stopped you from joining us this week.

We are especially grateful to all the exercise leaders and expert helpers for their additional effort during the exercise sessions. We could not have a workshop of this scale without you!

We hope that our Git lessons have made you more comfortable using Git for your solo- and collaborative- projects. Of course, we would have loved to show a lot more if we had the time. If you have ideas on how to improve them (some ideas were already noted in the collaborative document), please open issues at https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/ or https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/, or even better, send us pull requests.

During next weeks we'll take best practices for software development to the next level, by learning about documentation, testing, reproducibility, software licensing, and more. We'll start using additional tools. If you have not yet set up your Conda environment, please do so during the following days: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/.

**The following episodes are self-contained,** so you can pick the one(s) that are more relevant to what you need in your research. Please note that the starting time and duration have changed now. 

If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.

Have a nice weekend and see you on Wednesday!
