Hello!

Today we covered the basics of git and tomorrow we will collaborate together using git and GitHub. If you missed today (or yesterday) it is still possible to fully enjoy tomorrow and do exercises together.

**A short reminder on what you need to do before tomorrow**

Tomorrow we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.

If you would like to participate as **individual learner** in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at 
https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new?template=access-request.md (there click the green button "Create" on bottom right).

This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.

After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.

Please accept the invitation.

Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.

To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".

That is all for today. You may find today's video on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week. Recordings are also being uploaded to our YouTube channel later next week.

Have a great evening!
Enrico, on behalf of the CodeRefinery team
