# Final Feedback
## One good thing about the workshop as a whole:
- Extremely useful topics and it is good as "Introduction".
- Very nice overview, i'm very glad to have taken the time to join +1
- It was a lot to cover so despite some minor flwas, you did a great job! And thanks for your hard work all.


## One thing to improve for next time:
- Add more "How AI can help", cause I feel it indeed can. Also includ debugging session.
- Maybe organize at the end some "debates", on few topics (including RSE pathway), with more people involved (not only two speakers),and let people ask quesitons live (no coding), have a moderator. Try to make people more involved. And eventually get to know each other (if lsitening home alone like me XD ). Those Zoom options for excercizes were rather good on occassoion.
- In a meantime build a wider and stronger community. Focus also on networking, using e.g. Slack. Not sure how Zulip works.
- I think better time management across the different topics would be beneficial. For example, some topics require more time than others, depending on the audience's level of experience. Jupyter notebooks and modularization seem more suitable for beginners, at least in my case. On the other hand, we didn't have time to further explore topics like automated testing and documentation in more depth during the lectures (specially the testing topic, which was covered too quickly and wasnâ€™t explored in enough depth). It would also be nice to have a class on good coding practices, especially in terms of writing style (PEP8/Flake8).
