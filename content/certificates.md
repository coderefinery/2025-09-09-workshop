## Certificates and credits

It is possible to obtain a certificate from the course with a little extra
work.  The certificate is equivalent to 1 ECTS and your study supervisor will
be able to register it as a credit in your university study credit system.
**Please make sure that your supervisor/study program accepts it**.

To obtain a certificate, you must be affiliated with a university, or similar
research organisation. We expect you to **follow all 9 sessions** of the course; 
note that you can catch up by watching the recording in case you missed a session. 

More instructions will follow soon.
