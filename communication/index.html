          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your active participation during the first week of the CodeRefinery workshop!</p>
<p><strong>If you could not join us this week, could you let us know why? <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/BCA7C9465741A5AC">Take this 15-seconds-survey</a></strong>.</p>
<p>We try to minimise overlaps with conferences and other events, so we would like to know what stopped you from joining us this week.</p>
<p>We are especially grateful to all the exercise leaders and expert helpers for their additional effort during the exercise sessions. We could not have a workshop of this scale without you!</p>
<p>We hope that our Git lessons have made you more comfortable using Git for your solo- and collaborative- projects. Of course, we would have loved to show a lot more if we had the time. If you have ideas on how to improve them (some ideas were already noted in the collaborative document), please open issues at https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/ or https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/, or even better, send us pull requests.</p>
<p>During next weeks we'll take best practices for software development to the next level, by learning about documentation, testing, reproducibility, software licensing, and more. We'll start using additional tools. If you have not yet set up your Conda environment, please do so during the following days: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/.</p>
<p><strong>The following episodes are self-contained,</strong> so you can pick the one(s) that are more relevant to what you need in your research. Please note that the starting time and duration have changed now.</p>
<p>If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.</p>

          <p>Hello!</p>
<p>Today we covered the basics of git and tomorrow we will collaborate together using git and GitHub. If you missed today (or yesterday) it is still possible to fully enjoy tomorrow and do exercises together.</p>
<p><strong>A short reminder on what you need to do before tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>Tomorrow we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.</p>
<p>If you would like to participate as <strong>individual learner</strong> in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at
https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new?template=access-request.md (there click the green button "Create" on bottom right).</p>
<p>This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.</p>
<p>After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.</p>
<p>Please accept the invitation.</p>
<p>Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.</p>
<p>To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".</p>
<p>That is all for today. You may find today's video on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week. Recordings are also being uploaded to our YouTube channel later next week.</p>
<p>Have a great evening!
Enrico, on behalf of the CodeRefinery team</p>

          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>We are near the end of the CodeRefinery workshop series, but we still have two very important and often overlooked topics coming up!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Wednesday 15th/October, we continue our weekly series of self-contained events focused on specific topics.</p>
<p>Tomorrows episode is dedicated to automated testing:
We will step a little deeper into software development practices by giving you an introduction into automated testing and how this could benefit you and your collaborators. We will take a look how testing can be integrated as part of the research code development cycle and practice designing and writing tests.</p>
<p>If you want to follow the exercises tomorrow with Python you will need the CodeRefinery conda environment setup (https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/conda/). You may also follow some of the exercises in R, Julia, C++ or Fortran, please refer to the language specific instructions in the test design lesson: https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/ .</p>
<p>If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.</p>

          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your active participation during the first days of the CodeRefinery workshop.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Wednesday 8th/October, we continue our weekly series of self-contained events focused on specific topics.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's episode is dedicated to <strong>Jupyter notebooks</strong>: Have you ever wished your code, data, and explanations could live together in one beautiful, shareable document? How are Jupyter notebooks used in research projects?</p>
<p>The exercises tomorrow will require Python or and the CodeRefinery conda environment.</p>
<p>If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.</p>

          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your active participation during the first four days of the CodeRefinery workshop. We have had more than 700 views so far, we are happy to see that you find our training useful! You can find recordings of the past episodes at the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fwmkB2A6Vs&amp;list=PLpLblYHCzJAAqSSVAwHUuipB5hhW6GobY">CodeRefinery YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you could not join us so far, could you let us know why? <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/BCA7C9465741A5AC">Take this 15-seconds-survey</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Wednesday 23/September, we continue our weekly series of self-contained events focused on specific topics.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's episode is dedicated to <strong>social coding</strong>: open-source software, software licenses, and how to publish your code. To work in modern science, you need to build on the work of others - both scientific and code. Can you copy code from Stack Overflow? Can you copy from your colleagues? Can you copy form ChatGPT? Does your code and data exist after you leave your position? We'll discuss all these and more.</p>
<p>The exercises tomorrow will not require any Python or git.</p>
<p>If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/certificates/.</p>

          <p>Hello dear workshop participant,</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us today!</p>
<p>You may find the archived questions and answers at https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09/workshop/questions/.</p>
<p>If you'd like to revisit or catch up with some of the episodes, you find the videos on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week. Recordings will later be uploaded to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@coderefinery.</p>
<p>If you missed day 1, you may still join the rest of the workshop; prerequisites for day 2 are knowing the basics of git. And even without those, you should still be able to follow and do the exercises.</p>
<p>Preparations for day 2
Having the local editors available on your computer is good: VS Code or command line. See the second option on installation (https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). If you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps you can do without editors, and you'll learn for the future.</p>
<p>If you need live help for installing these tools, we provide an exceptional zoom session tomorrow morning 10/9/2025 at 9:00am CEST (Oslo/Stockholm/Rome timezone).</p>
<p>Preparations for day 3
On Day 3 (Thursday 11/9) we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.</p>
<p>Day 3 for individual learners
If you would like to participate as individual learner in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at
https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new?template=access-request.md (there click the green button "Create" on bottom right).</p>
<p>This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.
After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.
Please accept the invitation so that on Thursday you can do the exercise on our shared repository.</p>
<p>Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise
and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded  to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.
To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".</p>
<p>Day 3 for learners in local classrooms or teams
If you are learning with others as part of an in-person room or a virtual team, your local coordinator will take care of preparing the shared git repository for doing the collaborative exercise with other participants in the room. If you are the coordinator you'll receive a separate email from us with more detailed instructions.</p>

          <p>Hei classroom hosts and exercise/team leads,</p>
<p>You are receiving this e-mail because you have indicated in some way that you are hosting a classroom or joining with a team for the CodeRefinery workshop.</p>
<p>First: it's amazing that you provide a space to learn together for the CodeRefinery workshop! We know it's still a day ahead, but never too early to prepare: For day 3 we do collaborative git version control, and that requires you to prepare some repositories in advance so that the learner in your room can collaborate using the repository you have created.</p>
<p>Please have a look at all exercises for day 3 (https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/exercises/#day-3), there are step-by-step instructions on how to prepare these git repositories for your learners to work with.</p>
<p>For example, for the first exercise of day 3 https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/same-repository/#exercise you see that in the tab "Part of team/exercise room" there are a few steps for the <strong>maintainer</strong> (you! (or one of you if you have multiple helpers)) to generate the new repositories under your own github handle, and to add the learners as collaborators to your repository. (You will also need to create a repository for the third exercise of day 3 https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/forking-workflow/#exercise.) It is good to do this before day 3 sessions start.</p>
<p>If you would like support with setting things up, please visit our "additional installation help" session on Wednesday, 2 hours before the workshop starts.</p>
<p>Please do reach out via support@coderefinery.org or join our Zulip chat (https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) if anything is unclear.</p>
<p>Kind regards,
Samantha on behalf of the CodeRefinery team</p>

          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>We are happy to have you onboard of the next Coderefinery workshop that starts on <strong>Tuesday September 9th</strong> at 11am CET. Full schedule and details at the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/"><strong>September 2025 CodeRefinery workshop webpage</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 id="before-the-workshop-pre-requisites">Before the workshop: pre-requisites</h3>
<p>If you plan to participate in the hands-on exercises for this workshop, please ensure you have the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/"><strong>necessary pre-requisites prepared by visiting this link</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We provide multiple ways to learn Git: via GitHub web-interface, using the shell terminal, using VS code.</p>
<p>Using Git in the shell terminal gives you full control over your workflow, but you might not be familiar with the terminal itself. If you’d like to take advantage of Git’s full power through the command line, we offer a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/xbTTDLA3txI"><strong>shell crash course</strong></a> just before our installation session.</p>
<p>If you need assistance with the installation, we offer two help sessions on <strong>Wednesday September 3rd</strong> and <strong>Monday September 8th</strong>. Please check the schedule in your time zone: https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/#schedule . You can also ask someone you know for installation help - these are standard tools and they can probably give you custom advice.</p>
<p>Connection details for the installation help sessions and the shell crash course: <strong>zoom link sent to participants</strong> .</p>
<p>You can add all workshop sessions to your own calendar following the instructions on this page: https://coderefinery.org/calendars/ (choose only the workshop calendar)</p>
