<p>https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/</p>
<p>Let's have some <strong>icebreakers!</strong> :icecream:</p>
<p>If you could have a fully paid holiday right now, we cover all your costs, what would you like to do? Where would you go?</p>
<ul>
<li>I would take my family to some warm place with sea/swimming pool and amazing fresh food like fruits, veggies, fish...</li>
<li>Spend a week on one of the canary islands with my family and/or friends</li>
<li>Visit my family in the Austrian alps</li>
<li>I'd just stay home and enjoying doing nothing!</li>
<li>I'd like to take my family to Swiss Alps</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have a paper notebook at hand?</p>
<ul>
<li>I love post-its with different colors for different things, but they are not the same thing</li>
<li>For important things I like to have a physical place where to write things</li>
<li>Always! ...</li>
<li>I write my (mental) pipelines with pen and paper</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your way of working when it comes to writing code for your research projects?</p>
<ul>
<li>If I am not reusing previous version of scripts / pipelines, I first sketch things with Jupyter/R-studio interactively, then rewrite the jupyter bits into python scripts / RScripts, and run them from terminal for the final analysis (to avoid having results without being 100% sure on what the running order of cells / R lines was).</li>
<li>do some analysis in IPython (a terminal version of jupyter notebooks), copy the code from IPython to python files (with %save), glue together those python files with a bash script &lt;- should replace this with a proper workflow manager I think</li>
<li>I am a total beginner, happy to hear what works for others. +1</li>
<li>..</li>
<li>..</li>

<p><em>Please remember to set the TwitcTV stream quality to "source"</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Can you please increase the volume?
<ul>
<li>You should be able to increase the volume in the Twitch video to your likings. Does that make it loud enough?</li>
<li>Is it better now?</li>
<li>Yes, Thank you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seems some difference in audio volume between different speakers - XXXXXXXX fairly quiet compared to the rest
<ul>
<li>Thanks. We can fix it. (I won't talk at all basically)</li>
<li>LOL</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Forgot to mention about breaks: There will be one break (in about an hour) and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/2025-09-09-workshop/exercises/#day-7">two exercise sessions</a> today (one before and one after the break).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter notebooks</h2>
<p>Course material: https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/motivation/</p>
<p>Your questions here:
3. What is the differene between Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab? Is it ok to use Jupyter Lab just not using all the features if not needed?
- We will get to that in a bit
- For today it is OK to work with either
- For the record and future readers:
- Jupyter Notebook: the core system that interprets the notebook files (json) and via web browser allows communication with the kernel which runs the python bits that are on each cell
- Jupyter Lab: a development tool that also includes ways to start terminals, work with git, browse file system. It is basically a fully working IDE that runs inside your web-browser
- Bonus (for more confusion): Jupyter HUB: a large scale web application that allows multiple users to start their instances of jupyter lab. Most likely your university is running jupyter-hub, to let you start jupyter-lab sessions, and in those sessions you will run a jupyter-notebook :)
4. How does this compare to R Markdown? (Thank you so much for all these answers, guys! :D )</p>
<ul>
<li>R markdown is written in plain text almost as code, while a jupyter notebook is something more in the "what you see is what you get". Also R markdown is mostly for R (although you can use other languages there...)</li>
<li>Also, jupyter notebooks are developed in a browser, while R-markdown notebooks are mostly written in RStudio (correct me if I am wrong)
<ul>
<li>jupyter notebooks can be also edited using vscode (with a plugin), possibly offering a more similar experience to RStudio/RMarkdown?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe what I feel as the biggest difference is that Jupyter notebooks have a more interactive element, Rmarkdown is more about writing a reproducible document with text and code (and results) all in one place.</li>
<li>Maybe Quarto combines both world of Rmarkdown "papers with code" and Jupyter "interactivity". See examples https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/</li>
<li>Tooling: there is quite some tooling developed for jupyter notebooks: difftools, validation tools, converters to/from various other formats and ways to include those in documentation corpora. I am not sure about RMarkdown</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-user-interface">The user interface</h2>
<p>Course material: https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/interface/</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Actually there seems to be one icon fewer in my Jupyter notebook UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>out of curiosity, which one is missing? (I doubt it will affect your work)</li>
<li>It looks like the version control icon is missing, am I right?
<ul>
<li>I think so</li>
<li>Do you have the version control button on the side? Above the table of contents?
<ul>
<li>No</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What fancy terminal app and plug-ins does the presenter use? They look fine as heck. (not the vs code one, the previous one where he was in his mac terminal)</p>
<ul>
<li>ok, we can ask him to fill this info during the break :) (thanks!)</li>
<li>The terminal is called Warp: https://www.warp.dev/, I also use <code>zsh</code> instead of bash.  The downside of warp is you have to create an account and login... But it's a great terminal! (thank you, i will take a look at it because it seems really helpful with the autocompletion and suggestions : ) )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What tool do you recommend for version control of a notebook? Now every time I rerun a book, there is some diff shown up. I don't want those to be in the git history.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will be discussed later. git has a filter mechanism that can be configured for that. ("nbdime" is the search word)</li>
<li>The nbdime program can be set up to be used with git: see https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/version-control/#using-nbdime-on-the-command-line</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise</h2>
<p>Instructions: https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/sharing/#sharing-dynamic-notebooks-on-binder</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a public repository with the pi calculate example and connect it to Binder</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional Exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/sharing/#importance-of-tracking-dependencies
:::</li>
</ul>
<p>Your questions here:
9. It took forever to launch it. Is this usual for a first time notebook? It didnt take that long with the other (oohhhh ok get it)
- So yes, the first time means creating the environment as well.
10. I used matplotlib==3.10.1 and it worked in case that helps
- good to know :)
12. Is the jupyter lab through binder running on our local machine or it is on a cloud?
- in the cloud</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>So we didnt <strong>specified where</strong> is our <strong>dependency list</strong> when launching on <strong>Binder</strong>, it is preassummed on requirements.txt in the root of the repository?
<ul>
<li><del>if you are using the coderefinery conda environment, then the dependencies were installed in the conda env</del> (edit: irrelevant for binder)</li>
<li>yes, for Binder the requirements.txt at the root of the repository defines the dependencies (see <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/sample_repos.html#python-environment-with-a-requirements-txt">here</a>. An alternative is the <code>environment.yml</code> for a conda env (see <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/binder-examples/conda">here</a>)</li>
<li>Also, if its a R notebook, you should have a runtime.txt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="widgets">Widgets</h2>
<p>Instructions: https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/extra-features/#widgets
14. I had trouble getting matplotlib to behave interactively with widgets when %inline is invoked. Maybe remove that? I think matplotlib has a quick way to invoke its widget with %widget as well
- Thank you for sharing, this also worked for the instructor! &lt;3
15. Can you please repeat how to enable rich git diff on GitHub website directly?
- Click on you profile picture, and then feature preview, and then rich jupyter notebook diff.
16. Can you send us last notebook with interactive function via widgets
17. AttributeError: <code>np.Inf</code> was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release. Use <code>np.inf</code> instead. Kindly help</p>

Today we looked into Jupyter notebook and you got to play around with it.
Next week (same time same place) we will continue with a lesson on automated testing.
You will get some hints on how you may prevent yourself and others from breaking your working code by running tests manually and automatically.</p>

<p>Today was ... (vote for all that apply):
Speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>..too fast:</li>
<li>..too slow: o</li>
<li>..right speed: oo</li>
<li>..too slow sometimes, too fast other times:ooo
Level:</li>
<li>..too advanced:</li>
<li>..too basic: ooo</li>
<li>..right level:oo
Usage and recommendation:</li>
<li>..I will use what I learned today: ooooo</li>
<li>..I would recommend today to others: ooooo</li>
<li>..I would not recommend today to others:</li>
</ul>
<p>One good thing about today:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content may have been basic but I get why it is super important to know how to handle these things and it was presented at an overall nice pace, so kudos for that</li>
<li>..both speaker taught are same pace and level</li>
<li>..</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to improve for next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe add one more exercise or theme in this session where we connect to a cluster with a jupyter notebook and work in data analysis, using installed programs on the cluster, submitting SLURM and things like that. o
<ul>
<li>That would be great, but unfortunately not everyone has access to a cluster, or even the need to work on a cluster and learn how to deal with it.</li>
<li>Understandable. I am looking forward for more specialised courses then offered from you with these things in mind in the future.</li>
<li>Our friends at Aalto university have a HPC kickstart course, but I am unsure if Jupyter is a part of that: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2025/ (it does not, I just learned, but anyway leaving the link here for review :) )</li>
